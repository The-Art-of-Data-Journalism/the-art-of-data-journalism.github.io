The WI Department of Natural Resources notified the city that the water distribution system exceeded lead limits so the city is required to remove all lead service lines and lead-jointed water main pipes. The sanitary sewer mains in the project area are nearing the end of their useful life, have clay tile pipes that are broken and have root intrusions. If left unattended, these issues will cause increased infiltration and inflow at the wastewater treatment plant and increase the risk for customer back-ups. This water and sewer upgrade project will include full reconstruction of approximately five miles of city streets including replacement of about 20,000 feet of lead-jointed water mains and will address failing sanitary sewer collection system components. The removal of all lead components from the water system will reduce the lead levels currently present in the drinking water and return lead levels in the citys drinking water to an acceptable level.

A combination of well capacity plus storage capacity, is inadequate to meet current fire flow demands to the village. The village must operate at least one well continuously to ensure a sudden demand does not drain the tower, causing the system to lose pressure and lead to a boil water notice. The village has indicated that utility operators have had to sleep at a wellhouse to ensure system pressure is maintained while the existing water tower is down for maintenance. The water system has experienced 150 water main breaks since 2015 when it began tracking them and have identified several areas with a concentration of main breaks in need of repair. An analysis determined there are hydraulic limitations due to distribution system pipe sizes that do not allow for the village to operate all three wells at the same time without overflowing the existing water tower and over pressurizing the distribution system.",8500000,1
