The project is used as a fueling station and convenience store with both hot-and-ready and grab-and-go food geared toward the trucking industry and general public. The facility is located along I-84 at Hwy 30, with I-84 being Oregon & Washingtons primary East-West route with Idaho, Utah and beyond. The travel center sits about 30 miles from the Idaho border and is about 85 miles west of Boise, Idaho and 138 miles southeast of Pendleton, Oregon. One of the main reasons the site was chosen is that it shares the highway exit with an Oregon-State weigh station where commercial trucks are required to stop. This highway exit also serves as the gateway to a large regional park where travelers visit to stretch their legs, let their dogs out, etc, The Huntington Travel Center of America is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and has very good visibility from I-84 and Hwy 30 with electronic signage at the highway, providing a much needed service to rural Oregon travelers.",10026500,1

Since medical staff and patients will be accessing these portions of the facility, it is necessary to bring the HVAC system to current standards to minimize impacts from future pandemics similar to the current pandemic. In addition, the project includes new cold storage to increase vaccine storage capabilities. The new vaccine storage will be located in the same buildings benefiting from the funded HVAC upgrades.

Site work will also include excavation and backfill of gravel and topsoil. Five spring boxes currently supply drinking water for the utility, however, two of the five boxes are damaged and not in use. One well and one water treatment plant are also not currently in use. In addition to the spring, the OWWSA has a well that was drilled in 1992 that houses an aging and non-functioning filtration system. A localized landslide event in 2020 damaged the spring boxes and caused water to stop flowing to the springs. Also, in 2020, a drought emergency was declared in the area due to unusually low water supplies and hot, dry conditions. The drought reduced flows in the OWWSA springs and the conditions carried over into 2021. These two events resulted in a significant decline in water quantity and quality. Overall, this project will ensure that this small, rural water authority will have the needed funds for upgrades which will ensure their ability to provide safe, potable water to the surrounding community for years to come.",400000,1

Brookings Harbor Community Helpers, headquartered in Brookings, Oregon has been operating in Curry County since 1984. Funds will be used to support increased staffing including the hiring of a bilingual interpreter and advocate to bridge the gap with the Hispanic Community. Due to the on-going need in the community, the applicant has had to purchase additional storage solutions to store and provide emergency COVID-19 supplies and bulk food supplies. Food purchases are rising due to reduced supply from the regional food bank and the addition of a Senior Fresh Food program that provides fresh vegetables to qualifying seniors. Ultimately this program will improve food security and access to nutritional options as the pandemic evolves. The increased client traffic to the Food Bank & Help Center has increased the need for food, PPEs, vaccines, vaccine event information, COVID-19 education and other health related services. Brookings Harbor Community Helpers continues to see increases in the clientele served and their needs and the associated expenses that are projected over the next 36 months to serve the community.

The city of Gates, located 35 miles east of Salem, sustained major damage during the September 2020 wildfires. Roughly 50 percent of the homes and structures in the city were destroyed, resulting in exposed service lines and massive system leaks. This caused the reservoir to run dry, as the reservoir lacks backup power. In addition, the citys water intake has shown increased turbidity during the subsequent rainy seasons. The filters are unable to treat water this contaminated. If a steep, burned embankment fails, the water treatment plant will become inaccessible. Additionally, the Thistledown Booster Pump Station ran without water for an extended period causing damage and must be replaced to prevent future disruption of service. Overall, this project will ensure that the water facility in the heart of Gates, Oregon continues to provide vital services to the community for years to come.",400000,1
