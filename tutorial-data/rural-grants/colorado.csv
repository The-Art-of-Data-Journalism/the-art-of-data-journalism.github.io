This project will renovate a recently vacated senior center building into a modern and increased-capacity childcare facility. This will help address the concerning lack of childcare seats in the area by increasing the capacity of Seasons Schoolhouse to over 50 students. In addition to the increased preschool seats, this will allow for more childcare options to parents such as infant care and after-school programing, which were not previously available. In addition, this project will create an estimated 8 new full-time jobs at the facility.

This pipeline has been experiencing increasing breakages and leaks, and a 2012 survey determined that the soil is too corrosive in many areas along the pipe for the protection that is installed. This project will replace approximately 13,000 feet with High Density Polyethylene pipeline that is better able to withstand the corrosive soil. It will also install additional isolation valves to reduce water loss should a break occur. Overall, this project will also allow the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe to reduce servicing on the existing corrosion protection systems, saving the community money along with ensuring the community has access to clean water for years to come.",2000000,1

The former skilled nursing facility closed in 2020, forcing the areas residents to relocate to other facilities scattered throughout Colorado. The La Junta City Council commissioned a study and determined the area could support at least a 50-bed facility. Citizens of La Junta overwhelmingly voted to form the La Junta Health Service District and authorized a sales tax to make the facility a reality. This project will construct a new Green House or hybrid skilled nursing facility called Bluestem Village. The non-traditional facility will consist of four identical, stand-alone skilled nursing units with 14 beds per unit and a fifth building to include an administrative office and attached gathering area/community center. The development of an open, suburban site will include parking, sidewalks, landscaping, courtyard and walking paths on 35 acres of previously undeveloped land. The location is both close to the City and allows for future expansion (need is expected to rise to 117 beds in the future). Overall, this project will ensure the areas residents can live in their community and provide quality, skilled nursing care to the community going forward.",3590000,1

The Food Bank Network worked diligently to provide a stable presence for households struggling with the various crises arising from the pandemic. Substantial funding was expended on cleaning supplies and masks to further local public health safety goals. During the pandemic onset, their food supplies dwindled due to shortages from local donors and nationwide wholesale partners. Additional food was required to meet the increased demand for services and equipment and it was difficult to find funding for facilities to store the added food volume. This project will assist the Network to cover unexpected expenses and continue supplying nutritious foods to food-insecure residents. This will also lead to a decrease in medical costs, as food insecurity has significant impacts on health outcomes. It will allow the Network to continue their important mission of providing food to residents in the San Luis Valley, a rural region of 8,780 residents.",92000,1

Prior to the onset of the pandemic, the kitchen served approximately 23,000 meals a year using dishes and silverware that were cleaned and sanitized between use. Meals were served in the kitchens cafeteria which seated 70 diners. Implementing COVID-19 protocols including the use of foam to-go containers, plastic water bottles and plastic silverware that allowed the kitchens visitors to take their meals with them presented a substantial cost. In addition, supply chain issues also increased the cost of the kitchens bulk ingredients. This project will help offset these unexpected costs and allow La Puente Home to continue serving meals to those in need in this rural community of 8,780 residents.",85500,1

This leads to concerns regarding infection prevention, isolation of contagious pathogens, privacy and overall patient experience as well presenting challenges to staff attempting to care for these patients. This project will convert seven rooms, presently used for outpatient cardiopulmonary services, into flexible private suites, including two that will have negative-pressure heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems for enhanced infection control and isolation capabilities. All rooms will feature ADA-compliant bathrooms, LED lighting, air scrubbers and necessary technology updates for modern equipment and patient monitoring. It will also fund updates and new equipment for the nursing station that serves these rooms. Overall, this project will improve the level of care and pandemic resilience for this medical facility serving 8,780 rural residents while also alleviating the largest source of patient complaints about the current conditions.",1000000,1

This project will purchase an approximately 16,000-square-foot facility that is more modern, includes a proper showroom and provides HFH with a larger, more visible presence in the community that solves their current capacity issues. The purchase will replace the variable costs of facility and storage rental with one fixed cost of repaying the loan.

The Districts current facility is too small to house the fleets vehicles and there is insufficient parking to conduct training or education programs at the facility. There is no unused space on the lot to allow for any expansion to address these issues. Additionally, its geographical location in relation to the dispatch broadcast tower creates radio reception issues, resulting in delays to their response to emergencies as dispatchers have to call personal cell phones to get through. This project will help purchase a new facility located closer to the dispatch tower and population center of the City of Trinidad, remedying reception issues and reducing response times to emergencies. Both the proposed facility and the lot it sits on are also almost triple the size of their current property, allowing for the housing of all of the Districts vehicles and future expansion if necessary.

Though the cast-iron distribution lines originally installed in 1954 have seen upgrades to polyvinyl choloride (PVC) between 1981 and 2000, approximately 3,600 linear feet of cast-iron lines still remain. This project will construct a water treatment plant, allowing water from the best-producing wells to be brought to a central location for chlorination and radium and uranium treatment via filters. It will also allow for future water treatment expansion to meet increasing demand. The plant will reduce costs by centralizing water treatment and reducing the entry points requiring sampling and monitoring. The project will further reduce operating costs by replacing the remaining cast-iron pipe with PVC to reduce the occurrence of breaks in the line.

The colleges existing facility does not meet their operational needs, as it does not provide the appropriate food storage, a designated prep area, and is not Americans with Disabilities Act accessible. This project will include a grocery-style pantry that includes a food prep area and a resource hub. In addition to providing free healthy groceries, the center will also offer support resource navigation services such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program registration. In the past year, the college experienced a 233 percent increase in usage and a 427 percent increase in food distribution. The proposed design will allow the college to maximize food storage capacity, and provide areas for community-building and interaction. Additionally, the center has been intentionally placed near two established organizations that support Native American and Latino populations. Given that Fort Lewis College is primarily a Native American-serving non-tribal institution with more than 50 percent students of color, the project will help reduce existing inequalities and create a new model for addressing food security and rural agricultural development in the region.
