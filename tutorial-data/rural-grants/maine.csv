The main base in Dover-Foxcroft is the largest. The pandemic and the high positivity rate in Piscataquis County have increased the transport volume of U-121 patients (those exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms). COVID-19 has also increased out-of-service time for ambulances as they are rigorously cleaned between runs. Transport of U-121 patients is markedly more complex than usual, requiring full personal protective equipment of the staff as well as respirators and face shields.

A critical component of Piscataquis Regional Food Centers ability to meet the communitys needs is the capacity to safely store food products in frozen, refrigerated, and shelf-stable forms until they can be delivered to rural distribution partners or direct to those in need. This requires a reliable and uninterrupted year-round source of electricity. Without backup power, their ability to support their community is at risk if there is any significant grid power disruption. The COVID-19 emergency demonstrated the rural regions need for food assistance can dramatically increase in scope with almost no warning.

The Town of Hartland is operating a 3.5-acre Special Waste landfill that is state-of-the-art with leak detection and liner systems in place. The operation sends the leachate all the way to the waste water treatment plant where any solids get pulled out and returned to the landfill, and the water is returned to the environment. The development of the remaining licensed 5.3 acres will have the same leak detection capabilities and liners that the existing area has. The development of this area will provide a service to neighboring towns, businesses, as well as continuing to service our own town. We estimate that, at current waste placement levels, we will add approximately 12 to 15 years of life to the landfill operation. In addition, a fence for privacy will be added and a set of scales for better on-site control and measurement of incoming waste streams.",3000000,1
