To comply with the order the water distribution system will see the replacement of 27,000 linear feet of existing small diameter line with larger waterlines as well as connections and fire hydrants for improved fire safety. Also, the funding will address inadequate water pressure in three different areas of the city, the project includes the rehabilitation of two pressure relief stations. To provide proper water treatment and fluoride removal, a new building will be constructed to house a three-stage, one pass, reverse osmosis system. The new treatment facility will connect to the existing infrastructure including the wells, storage tank and a booster station.

Because of this, the system components vary in age, anywhere from a couple of months to 80 years.
