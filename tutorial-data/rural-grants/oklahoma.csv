Far Away Ranch adjusted its business model to improve the vagaries of the cattle market, increase revenue from operations, and provide consumers with a higher quality locally produced product. The ranch is operating and producing grass-fed, grain-finished Black Angus beef cattle with an established feeding process resulting in a premium natural-flavored tender beef product. The ranch will expand its customer base to local grocery stores, cafes, and restaurants; a market segment the ranch has not previously entered.
