This solar array project builds on a Rural Development investment in FY 20 for LED lighting in the school system. The LED project lowered energy usage, and this project will provide the renewable energy for the lower energy needs. This project is expected to produce 127,000 kilowatt hours of electricity, and over the next 25 years nearly 3 million kilowatt hours which is equivalent to 4.6 million pounds of avoided carbon dioxide emissions. These cost savings will help reduce the operational cost of the organization, freeing up funds for curriculum development and greater learning opportunities for students. Every dollar saved on energy is a dollar that can stay within the school system and be redirected in ways that benefit the community.",182000,1

The Town of Stratford is a rural community of approximately 681 people located in Coos County, and has repurposed the hundreds of trails and logging roads as outdoor recreational areas after the manufacturing and timber industry left the area. These trails require off-road vehicles to reach hikers who need emergency assistance, allowing for quicker rescues as well as wildfire mitigation. The new vehicle will be a multi-person utility task vehicle that can be used year-round to provide rescue services, transport first responder personnel and equipment to rescue scenes, and transport patients as needed. The unit will be equipped with a track system for winter use. Currently the department has no off-road vehicle and must rely on mutual aid for access to rescue scenes, which may delay medical services to the residents.",29800,1
