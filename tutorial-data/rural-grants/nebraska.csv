The site for the outdoor market is in a prime location of downtown called Hebron and is accessible to all ages, income levels, and is easily accessed from Highway 81. By constructing a permanent space, Hebron will be able to host several community events throughout the spring, summer and fall seasons and encourage a wide variety of small businesses (e.g. food trucks, produce vendors, local crafters) across Thayer County to promote and sell goods and services within downtown Hebron. This could, in turn, increase long-term investment in Hebron downtown and generate additional sales tax for the community. The market would complement county-wide business retention by showcasing local goods and services while also encouraging job creation by providing an extra venue to host events that increase part-time and seasonal employment opportunities.
