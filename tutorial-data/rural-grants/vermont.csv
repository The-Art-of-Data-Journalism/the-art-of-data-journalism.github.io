Springfield has experienced protracted economic hardship due to the closure of manufacturing, specifically tool and die machining. Since the mid-90s, the properties have been underutilized or vacant. One building still has an extremely inefficient oil-fired steam boiler as the primary source of heat. The goal of this project is to dramatically reduce the carbon footprint of these two marquee buildings that feature 8,000 square feet of prime downtown community retail and office space. By retrofitting both buildings with electric heat infrastructure and air handlers, all oil-heating systems can be removed. Substantial weatherization of the envelope is also necessary, including the total removal and replacement of old plate glass windows with historically sincere, energy-efficient windows, and substantially more insulation within exterior walls, allowing the buildings to operate in the cold Vermont climate with no oil or propane fuel demand. The project is estimated to save more than $17,600 annually, representing a 75-percent energy consumption reduction.",214911,1
