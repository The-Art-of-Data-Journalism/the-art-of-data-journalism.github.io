The water has a noticeable discoloration due to a combination of corroded pipeline and an inferior water supply. The groundwater is high in hardness, iron, and manganese. This project represents the second phase of the rehabilitation of the existing water system where two-thirds of the distribution system was previously replaced. The proposed project will replace the abandoned well and replace the remaining 1.5 mile portion of cast iron waterline with 9,300 feet of 4-inch PVC pipe, construct two new wells with chemical feed buildings, and includes 185 new meters, 90 meter settings, 14 valves, and 9 fire hydrants.
