The removal of the exterior paint coating on the tank will consist of pressure washing, then spot priming any areas that need touched up. An application of a new exterior paint will restore the integrity of the tank coating. In addition to the tank painting, renovating the valve vault for structural integrity and functionality will allow for safer operation of the water system. The addition of a radio-read meter system will provide more efficient, accurate, and prompt readings of customer water usage in the system. Adding a new western master meter will enable pit water to pass through the West Milford water system, lessening the amount of ""dead water"" on that side of the system and allowing another entry point for water to flow into the system in the event of an emergency.
