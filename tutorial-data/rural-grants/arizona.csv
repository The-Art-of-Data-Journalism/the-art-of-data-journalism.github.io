The proposed Navajo Financial Cooperative Feasibility Study and Business Plan will be used to develop a reservation-based financial/credit union cooperative program where a Din/Native American-owned financial institution can help combat credit deserts in rural and Indigenous areas. The Navajo Nation lacks access to financial entities, and the surrounding rural communities as well; and financial cooperatives and credit unions help strengthen the economy and empower people with ownership over their financial institution. The objective of establishing a Navajo Financial Cooperative is to develop a reservation-based credit union such as a type of financial institution similar to a commercial bank that will be a Navajo member-owned financial cooperative, controlled by its Navajo/Native American members and operated on a not-for-profit basis. The financial/credit union coop will provide services to members similar to retail banks, including deposit accounts, provision of credit, and other financial services that is currently lacking on the reservation.",95000,1
