The agency is a government-owned corporation responsible for water quality, management, and supply in Puerto Rico. On September 20, 2017, Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico as a category four hurricane. The strongest atmospheric disaster on the island in the last 85 years, leaving catastrophic damages throughout the jurisdiction. Sustained winds and torrential rainfall caused widespread devastation damaging powerlines. Floods and loss of electrical power caused the shutdown of most of the islands potable water and wastewater systems posing an immediate threat to the environment, public health, and safety. All the infrastructure in Puerto Rico was severely affected, including PRASAs water and wastewater plants, pump stations, wells, properties, and buildings. Proposed funds will be used to reimburse the applicant for emergency expenses incurred on several sewer facilities after the passing of Hurricane Maria in 2017.",14506059,1

This community was developed in the early 2000s and consists of 269 residences. The project included housing construction, sewer collection system and a package wastewater treatment plant. At the time there was no utility sewer system close to the community. Years later in 2010 the local aqueduct and sewer authority constructed a regional wastewater treatment plant approximately 1.5 miles from the community, unfortunately, since then, the community has been suffering problems with sanitary spills. The project consists in financing a Preliminary Engineering Report and Environmental Report to evaluate practical options to manage their sanitary water system. The community seeks to identify repairs required to solve these sanitary issues. Once the repairs are complete, the community will pursue connection to the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority system.",19000,1

The Municipality is estimated to generate approximately 48,851 tons of non-hazardous solid waste every year. Hurricane Mara produced tremendous amounts of waste in the period spanning October 2017 to December 2018, and abruptly reduced the landfills lifespan by approximately 1.65 years (20 months). Consequently, the existing cell will reach its operational capacity within the next six to eight months. It also destroyed the existing cells leachate collection system, thereby creating a serious health and safety hazard for neighboring communities and placing underground aquifer systems and nearby streams at risk of leachate spillage. The new cells will feature a geo-membrane liner to trap and contain leachate. It will also manage storm waters, and methane gas generation. All of these improvements will provide the landfill system an additional 21 useful years of operation.",23693000,1

The system serves a population of approximately 848 people. During the Hurricane Maria recovery, the community was left with no secure water source for five months due to lack of electrical power. During that period, they occasionally received water from the National Guard and were lent a power generator for a short time. Another challenge they have faced is that since December of 2019, Puerto Rico has been impacted by a series of earthquakes and aftershocks that provoked the complete shutdown of the Costa Sur power generator, consequently, an already beaten-up power grid system has become completely unreliable. The purpose of this project is to acquire a back-up power 40 kilowatt (kW) power generator with a transfer switch and installation. This will ensure that the system has access to a continuous source of safe drinking water and maintains the adequate quantities that meet the standards set by the Safe Drinking Water Act.",23993,1

This left many areas with no electrical power for long months. During the recovery period the community had to use an old 30kw generator to operate the system 10 hours a day for a span of 5 months. As a result, the generator is very worn out and is not suitable to face another phenomenon such as Hurricane Maria. This project consists in replacing the 30 kilowatts (kW) generator with a new one including a transfer switch. This will enable the community to efficiently supply safe drinking water to the community in the event of any future disasters.",18663,1

Asociacin Villas de Guavate received a direct impact from Hurricane Mara that damaged the water supply and distribution systems, thereby compromising the Communitys access to the vital resource of safe and reliable water. Continuous electrical surges from PREPA damaged the water meter of the water supply well, fallen trees severely damaged distribution lines, and strong winds damaged the tablet chlorination system. Furthermore, the water tanks structural integrity was compromised after being empty for long periods of time and due to the lack of PREPA power for a period of over six months. The water system has one tank of 30,000 gallons that uses gravity to distribute water, one monophasic pump of 2 hp at a depth of 250 feet, and a tablet chlorinator that serves as a disinfection system. The cost overrun is needed to fund increase in construction costs. Technical provider assigned to the case was no longer with NRWA in PR and nobody kept close tract of Villas de Guavate until it was reassigned to the new provider. USDA RD requested comments addressed on EJCDC then its was recommended to change to a Small Contract Agreement . After back and forth emails on the documentation needed to be provided by engineer we received a completed Small Contract on July 2022. The contract was approved by USDA Eng. Sandimary Davila. Since it has elapsed 17 months of the original construction estimate the cost of the materials have increased substantially due to congestion in the supply-chain, and a strained labor market. After restoring the system to satisfactory conditions and in compliance with construction codes, the system will be in the following end state: the water storage tank will be refurbished, supply lines and part of the distribution lines will be replaced/repaired, a water meter will be replaced, the chlorination system will be replaced, and a back-up generator that will be stored in a concrete shelter room for mitigation purposes will be installed, ensuring continuous access to safe and reliable water in future emergency situation.",83500,1

Comunidad Guaraguao does not have an electric generator to face another atmospheric disaster that cause loss of power in the community. In the aftermath of Hurricaine Maria the community was without power for 6 months. The system consists of a 500-foot-deep well with a single phase 5HP pump and a water dam. It has two 25,000-gallon tanks that provide water to 88 families. This water is distributed with gravity throughout the community and is not disinfected. At this moment the well is not working, the community is using the water dam, with surface water without any treatment. Juana Diaz is a mountainous region near the south of the island. Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017 caused the entire island to be without electricity service. The Guaraguao community was no exception, they spent approximately 6 months without electricity. The effects of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico were devastating, including unprecedented damage to the electrical system, and drinking water services. Hurricane Maras damage to the community Guaraguao was no exception. After the hurricane, the community was without electricity for approximately 6 months and was incommunicado for 2 weeks. Due to heavy rains and landslides, the community was incommunicado for 2 weeks. It was not until the roads were cleared that the community was able to come out for help. Since this is a mountainous region, there is also no telephone or internet signal. Before Hurricane Maria, the community used the well, due to electrical problems, the motor, the pump, and the control panel were affected. Since then, the community has only distributed surface water. The community does not have an electric generator to face the electrical energy problems that arise in the community due to atmospheric disasters and infrastructure problems in the country. Replacement of the motor, pump and control panel is recommended to get the well up and running. The installation of a 20kw generator is also recommended so that the community is more prepared for the atmospheric phenomena and the electrical energy problems of the island.",28000,1

From these, an estimate of 45,483 tons are disposed at the landfill and some 3,368 tons are recovered and diverted for reuse and/or recycling. As a result, approximately 6.9 percent rate of recovery and diversion for all waste generated in Jayuya.
