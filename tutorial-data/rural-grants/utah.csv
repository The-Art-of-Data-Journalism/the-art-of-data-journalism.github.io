Currently, the town has one well and springs that supply their drinking water. In early 2020, Joseph Town reached out to Rural Development to discuss their emergency. Extreme drought conditions have been plaguing the community and have lowered source production causing the community to depend on the backup well and reducing the total flow available to 258 gpm, which is 26 gpm short of the state required flow for their system. Due to the drought, the system must take immediate action on the springs to avoid further inadequacies to the system.

Patients in need of medical care are transported to Sevier Valley Medical Center, however, this facility is unable to provide some specialized care services in acute trauma, pediatric, cardiac, burn, COVID-19 and cancer centers, and others that are available in metropolitan hospital facilities. This project will provide two ambulances to help transport patients from Sevier Valley to specialized care facilities around the state. When one ambulance is not in use, it can provide mobilization for COVID testing at county offices, businesses, care facilities, or workplaces. This resource could also provide an option for vaccine administration to those who are not mobile, by either transporting them to a vaccine location, or administering vaccines at their homes. An average transport is 335 miles round-trip, and Sevier County transports an average of 25 patients per month.
