Long Valley Charter School is a nonprofit public benefit corporation (LVCS) that operates two charter schools. Each school is recognized as a Local Education Agency (LEA) by the State of California, providing educational programs for grades TK-12. The project will be located in Doyle, California, Lassen County, a designated distressed community. Doyle is also in a Health Professional Shortage Area for Mental Health and a Medically Underserved Area. For the Service Area, Charter Schools can supply services to students in the county where they are located and any contiguous county. Under these parameters, the school could provide educational services to students in the rural communities of Lassen, Modoc, Plumas, Shasta, and Sierra Counties. However, because of the distances involved services are mainly restricted to Lassen and Plumas Counties. The school was originally started because the school district decided to close the Doyle location and the parents in the community did not want to bus their children to another community. LVCS originally planned for the construction of a new education facility in the community of Doyle. The new facilities had a planned gross building area of 17,757 square feet. The application was complete when the Board of Directors decided that they should pursue the purchase of the existing facilities they were renting from the Fort Sage School District. The School Board felt it was worth it to support the community with the remodeling of the existing school rather than let it go vacant and into disrepair. The new project will include the construction of a new multipurpose room and the installation of two new modular classrooms. The gross area of the existing facilities is 16,444 square feet and includes 10 classrooms, a library, two offices, a multipurpose room, kitchen, five storage areas and 10 restrooms. The facilities have a parking area and bus loading area, two basketball courts, a soccer field, a volleyball court, two playgrounds and extensive irrigated landscaping. The new construction will include a 6,100-sq-ft gym and two accessible restrooms and a storage area.

The Newcastle Fire Protection District (NFPD) has been dealing with a building that has been structurally falling apart. NFPD has repaired the sagging front wall, with shoring posts and the installed new steel beams and concrete to shore up the west side of the building. After the last repair, the county deemed that the building would need to be replaced with a new modern fire station, as the 100-year-old building would be too far beyond repair to safely house the fire department employees. The Newcastle Fire Protection District proposes to construct a new fire station on vacant land donated to the fire district that is centrally located in the districts jurisdiction. The new 6,500 square foot building will have an apparatus room of 4,000 square feet and 2,500 square feet of living and office space. The apparatus room will be a metal building and roof with sheet rock on the interior. The living and office area will be Type V wood construction with a metal roof, stucco exterior and sealed concrete floors.The District has already completed extensive site preparation including the required environmental, geological and impact reports, the District will contribute $978,357 total towards the project. The District, through a formal bidding process has accepted the lowest responsible bidder to construct the station.The project will ensure the residents of the city of Newcastle and surrounding Communities will have a safe new Fire Station with modern equipment to serve them in case of a fire event or medical emergency.",3775800,1

The new eight inch sewer main will be connected to an existing 33-inch sewer main, owned and operated by the Coachella Valley Water District (CVWD). The new sewer main will connect a subdivision, church, and community building located within the Torres-Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indian Reservation to the existing sewer collection system operated by CVWD. The housing units and facilities that will connect to the new sewer main currently discharge sewage into septic tanks located on each property. The Torres-Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indian tribe has determined that these tanks are failing and have caused seepage of sewage to ground water and in cases sewage has been detected above ground. The proposed project will allow the Tribe to abandon the failing septic tanks and allow them to connect to CVWDs existing sewage treatment system.",1319900,1

The Sierra County Roads & Transportation Department were reviewing their needs during this current fire season, they realized there was a need for a water truck on the eastern side of the county, since the only water truck currently was 80 miles to the west, after experiencing a major fire in 2020 near the city of Loyalton and the proximity of the current Dixie fire. The Sierra County project consists of the purchase of a water truck with 4,000-gallon capacity, sprayers, and equipped with a water cannon. The new water truck will allow Sierra County to cover the eastern side of the county, while their other water truck is stationed on the western side of the county. This will enable the county to have sufficient water supply for water demand during a fire event.The project will ensure the residents of Eastern Sierra County that a water truck will be in the area in case of a fire event.

The Sierra County Law Enforcement Department has recognized their need to correct their inefficient in-car communication system, also known as the Race Elimination Profile Act, and the need for two new all-wheel drive squad cars. Currently, they must travel 20+ miles back to the station to input the required race and gender identifying information, after an incident or arrest. The lack of mobile communication puts officers lives at risk. The Sierra County project consists of the purchase of two new Ford Explorer cars and Mobile Data Terminal Computers. All current vehicles will be equipped as well, which will allow significant improvements across the board for the agency. The new equipment will allow the department to perform all records-management, inputting of data during service requests or on patrol throughout the county. This will enable the department to improve data integrity during their officers shifts and give the department the ability to directly communicate or interact with the officers while they are in the field. The officers will no longer need to travel back to the hub, some 20-plus miles to complete reports, which will improve the safety of the officer.
