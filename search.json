    "text": "Here are the data sources used throughout the tutorials, in order of appearance:\n\nCensus Population Estimates by County\nA classic dataset used in data journalism education. From the Census Bureau’s Population Estimates office.\n\n\nUSDA Rural Development Investments Data\nData from the USDA covering grants, loans and other “investments” from the agency. Full data covers 2012 to 2024, though the tutorials use only 5 years. There is a data dictionary if needed.\n\n\nNTSB Airplane Crash Data\nThe National Transportation Safety Board has civilian accident investigations going back to 1962 searchable online. The tutorials only use the last 5 years. Once you enter a search, the results are downloadable.\n\n\nU.S. Department of Education College Scorecard Data\nWarning: This dataset is not for the faint of heart. You can bulk download it all here, but it’s big (390 MB zipped) and really, really, clunky. There’s multiple tables, and the main table is more than 3000 columns wide. I use this data because it’s highly relevant to college students, but I have to do a lot of pre-processing to make it usable in this format.\n\n\nU.S. Census Bureau Small Area Health Insurance Estimates (SAHIE) Program\nAnother Census Bureau program that is not The Census but very important. Data is cleanly organized and well documented. You can get it from an API or using Census data tools. Data going back to 2008.\n\n\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program Data\nData from large emitting facilities regulated by the EPA. Data is currently 2023 only.\n\n\nNational Conference of State Legislatures Data on State Legislative Partisan Composition\nData comes in PDFs but are not very hard to format. Note: The Great State of Nebraska has a unicameral legislature, members of which are called senators, which is why the tutorials only focus on state senate compositions.\n\n\nGroundhog Day Predictions Dataset from Groundhog-Day.com\nThe fun one of the bunch. If you follow the Get The Data link here you can bulk download the predictions going back many years. However, the further back, the thinner the data gets."

So in order to make these tutorials more meaningful to you, I’ve developed a system where you can localize them to your state. Now you don’t have to do this – they will work if you don’t. But if you don’t, every tutorial is going to be about the great state of Nebraska, my home. If you’re fortunate enough to be from the greatest state in the Union, you can do nothing. If you’re from somewhere else and want your tutorials to about that place, do the following."

Professor Waite didn’t completely hold our hand through everything, but I felt the material was very accessible and easy to learn with the tutorials we were given.”\n\n\n“The R studio tutorials were great because I was able to use them over and over between tutorials and the semester long project. It made coding easier to understand and do even though at times it would kick my ass, but I loved the challenge and once I got the hang of it my life got a lot easier.”\n\n\n“The tutorials are perfect. I really feel like they are built to be helping tool for students and are effective way how to teach something. And a bonus is that I can come back to them any day and review how things are done.”\n\n\n“The tutorials are really easy to follow and help me understand the goal of the assignments and how to complete them. They were also beneficial to have during the completion of the projects because it allowed me to look back at previous work and use it as a reference.”"

Students have to acquire the data, analyze it and document a story that would go deeper on that issue using what they found.\nIt’s difficult if your classes are larger, but have students do their own data journalism story. Go through the entire process of reporting, acquiring data, analyzing it, reviewing your work and publishing."
