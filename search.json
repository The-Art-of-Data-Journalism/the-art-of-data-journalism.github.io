So in order to make these tutorials more meaningful to you, I’ve developed a system where you can localize them to your state. Now you don’t have to do this – they will work if you don’t. But if you don’t, every tutorial is going to be about the great state of Nebraska, my home. If you’re fortunate enough to be from the greatest state in the Union, you can do nothing. If you’re from somewhere else and want your tutorials to about that place, do the following."

Many of my students have never done it before (and wonder why their computer runs so slow or crashes so often).\nIf, for some reason, you can’t update, don’t worry. Everything should still work. If you’re on a really old operating system, that might cause problems later with installing R Studio, but just install a version that will work on your machine and it will be fine.

Don’t ignore them. Don’t snooze them. Install them.\nWith an up-to-date operating system, now install the command line tools. To do this, click on the magnifying glass in the top right of the screen and type terminal. Hit enter – the first entry is the terminal app.\nIn the terminal app, type xcode-select --install and hit enter. Let it run.\n\n\nOn Windows:\n\nType Updates into the Cortana search then click Check for updates\n\n\n\nAfter the search for updates completes, apply any that you have.
